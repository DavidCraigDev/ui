# Integer Input

[Back to readme](/README.md)

A modified number input that only accepts whole (int) numbers, a common annoyance of the standard input type=number is that it allows characters such as e, +-, etc, while this is handled in the validations, many developers prefer to not accept invalid inputs in the first place.
